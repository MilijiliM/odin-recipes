<h2>Directions</h2> 
        <p>
            Step 1
        </p>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
        <p>
            Step 2
        </p>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        <p>
            Step 3
        </p>
        Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until smooth.
        <p>
            Step 4
        </p>
        Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
        <p>
            Step 5
        </p>
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
        <p>
            Step 6
        </p>
        Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
        <p>
            Step 7
        </p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.
